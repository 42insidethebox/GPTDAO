        section.section-1
          h2 Introduction
          ol
            li
              h3 A brief introduction
              p GPTDAO is a decentralized startup incubator that aims to revolutionize the way innovative projects in the blockchain space are supported, resourced, and funded. The project leverages community-driven decision-making and transparent governance, providing a unique platform for entrepreneurs to thrive in a decentralized ecosystem.
            li
              h3 Core Values and Principles
              p The GPTDAO platform is built on three main pillars:
              ul
                li Transparency: All actions, decisions, and financial allocations within the platform are open and visible to the community.
                li Community: The GPTDAO platform embraces a strong community-centric approach, with members actively participating in the development and growth of the projects.

              h3 Target Audience and Problem Statement
              p GPTDAO targets entrepreneurs, developers, and innovators who are passionate about creating blockchain-based projects. Traditional startup incubators often suffer from centralization, lack of transparency, and limited access to resources, making it difficult for many potential projects to succeed. GPTDAO addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized platform where the community can collectively decide on the projects to support and allocate resources accordingly.
            li
              h3  Decentralized Startup Incubation Model
              p The decentralized startup incubation model employed by GPTDAO offers several benefits:
              ul
                li Democratic decision-making: The community plays an active role in selecting and supporting projects, ensuring that the most promising and innovative ideas receive the necessary resources.
                li Shared success: As projects succeed, the entire community benefits from the increased value of the GPTDAO token, fostering a sense of collective ownership and achievement.
                li Access to resources: Projects incubated on the platform have access to a wide range of resources, including technical expertise, marketing support, and funding.

          ol
            li
              h3 Technical Architecture
              p GPTDAO is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a high-performance blockchain that offers compatibility with Ethereum's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This choice ensures a scalable and low-fee environment for the platform, allowing GPTDAO to offer various features and functionalities to its users.
              h3 Supporting Technologies
              ul
                li IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): A decentralized file storage system that enables efficient and secure data storage and retrieval for course materials, project documentation, and other resources.
                li Oracles: External data providers that facilitate communication between the GPTDAO platform and off-chain data sources, ensuring the platform has access to accurate, up-to-date information.
                li Smart Contracts: Programmable contracts that execute predefined actions on the blockchain when specific conditions are met. These contracts govern various aspects of the GPTDAO ecosystem, including tokenomics, project incubation, and community voting.
              h3 Technical Architecture
              p GPTDAO is designed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which means that its governance structure is decentralized and community-driven. This approach ensures that decision-making power is distributed among community members, who can participate in the platform's development through voting and proposing changes.
              h3 Decentralized Voting and Decision-Making
              ul
                li Token-Based Voting: GPTDAO token holders can participate in voting on key platform decisions, such as project selection, platform improvements, and funding allocation.
                li Proposals: Community members can submit proposals for new features, improvements, or initiatives. Proposals are then voted on by token holders to determine if they will be implemented.
              h2 Key Features and Functionalities
              h3 Free Courses
              p GPTDAO offers free courses on various topics, providing community members with valuable educational resources. These courses cover a wide range of subjects, from blockchain technology to entrepreneurship and marketing.

              .center-img
                img(src='/images/token-distribution.png' alt='Image 1')

              h3 Burn Mechanisms
              p The GPTDAO token has a built-in burn mechanism, with 1% of every transaction being burned. This process reduces the overall token supply over time, potentially increasing the token's value.
              h3 Liquidity Provisions
              p 1% of every transaction is sent to the unlocked liquidity wallet, ensuring that there is always liquidity available for traders.
              h2 Project Selection and Incubation
              p GPTDAO uses a community-driven approach to select and support innovative projects. Criteria for evaluating and incubating projects include:
              ul
                li Innovation and potential impact
                li Team expertise and experience
